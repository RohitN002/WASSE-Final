        <h3>Programme Structure</h3>
      <p>Keystone operates its eco-development work across the following seven thematic areas or ‘programmes’. Teams under all programme include roles mentioned in the organisational structure. Each programme works to achieve a mix of several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals listed below. All programmes are approached in an intersectional manner, with cross-sectoral activities mindfully planned to meet goals, be it through consulting barefoot expertise for building tribal archives within the People and Nature Collectives programme, adopting a gender justice lens within the Climate Change programme, or prioritising disaster responsiveness within the Organisational Development programme.</p>
